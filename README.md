## Arithmetic Unit:
Smooth-edge detector, identifying the type of each 2 Ã— 2 block of an image with eight-qubit grayscale. If the absolute differences of a block's second, third, and fourth-pixel values from the first-pixel value are all less or equal to 15, the block is identified as smooth. It is considered an edge block if one or more differences exceed 15.

## AngEmb_Strong_MAE: 
Optimizing the quantum circuit with angle embedding inputs, StronglyEntanglingLayers Ansatz, and MAE(mean absolute error) cost function.

## AmpEmb_Strong_MAE: 
Optimizing the quantum circuit with amplitude embedding inputs, StronglyEntanglingLayers Ansatz, and MAE(mean absolute error) cost function.
